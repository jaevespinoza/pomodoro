# Pomodoro Timer Application

This is a Pomodoro Timer application built using React, Material-UI for components, React-countdowncircle-timer for displaying countdown timers, and Redux Toolkit for state management. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

## Features

- Set custom timer durations for work and break intervals.
- Start and pause the timer.
- Visual indication of the current timer phase (work or break) using specific library.
- Circular countdown timer to display the remaining time for the current phase.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js (v18.17.1) and yarn installed on your development machine.
- Vite as your build tool.
